# initializr-demo

This was done because I wanted to host a Node.js project on a cloud infrastructure (Heroku in this case). This is basically a static page served by Node.js server. Last but not the least this demonstrates how easy it is to use a template like Initializr as well.

Skeleton code to build upon provided by Initializr project. Theme borrowed from Bootstrap.

Hosted on Heroku : https://secure-beyond-5933.herokuapp.com/

# TODO

* ~~Host it on Heroku/Any cloud based service~~ Done!

* Add a backend like MongoDB

* Use grunt tool.

* If possible use gulp and bower

* Rename the app to less cryptic name
